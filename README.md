# 330FinalProject
## Final Project for Q3 of Fullstack JavaScript

### Proposal and Task Breakdown
### Your Final Project proposal is due. You should submit a link to a GitHub repository that will house your submission. The project README should contain your project proposal. Your proposal should include:

### 1. A description of your project's context/subject matter (i.e. gaming, project management, image processing, etc.).
My project will be a comparison shopping tool for IRL grocery shopping

### 2. A description of what problem your project seeks to solve.
People often feel that one store is more expensive than another without hard data to back it up. It is rumored that stores will  mark down certain items like milk or bananas that consumers tend to know the price of, to give the perception that their store is less expensive. This application will attempt to track real grocery prices in stores to give consumers a fact based set of data to compare grocery prices in their geographic area.

### 3. A description of what the technical components of your project will be, including: the routes, the data models, any external data sources you'll use, etc.

### 4. Clear and direct call-outs of how you will meet the various project requirements.

### 5. A timeline for what project components you plan to complete, week by week, for the remainder of the class.
